# Documentation

Can be found in `doc` and also be build using templex to present it with a web server in a nice manner.
Use `npm/pnpm/cnpm run doc` or `yarn doc` to build the documentation and then `cd ./example/public && python -m http.server`
to make it accessible locally in your browser.

# Future Developement (TODOs)

-   make an example theme for templex
