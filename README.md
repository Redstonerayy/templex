# Templex

## Why Templex?

I wasn't able to configure Hugo and I also wanted my build system to exactly suit my needs.
Templex is therefore made for my use case (a website/blog builder) but I try to make
it as flexible as possible so it also matches **your** usecase.

## Documentation

Documentation resides in `./doc`. With `yarn doc` it will be copied into the example project
and build to `./public`. It can be viewed in the browser with
`cd ./public && python -m http.server`.

## Future Developement

### TODOs

-   make an example theme for templex
